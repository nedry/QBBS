Here is what I have... it's not much but it lists all the packages you need...

These are the preliminary set up instructions for setting up QBBS.
QBBS currently requires:

A "standard" installation of postgresql: The current version that we
have tested is 8.4, however, any version after version 7 should work
okay. In most cases, if installing from packages, you must install
the -dev package as well as the main package.

Detailed instructions for installing postgresql to be added here...

Ruby: version 1.9.2 or higher is required. If you are installing
ruby from source, you need to ensure you install xxx dependencies
before you compile Ruby. If you do not, you will have to install a
component separately, or you will not be able to install the Ruby PG
gem.

Lets start with some dependencies...

sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get -y install curl git-core python-software-properties

It is recommended that Ruby 1.9.x is installed from source.

wget ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.3-p286.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ruby-1.9.3-p286.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.9.3-p286/
./configure
make
sudo make install

Sometimes Ruby fails to install its openSSL extension. If this isn't
installed Sinatra will fail to function. To install the openSSL
extension:

cd <ruby source dir>/ext/openssl
extconf.rb install

For ubuntu/debian, install the following postgres packages. You must install the dev
package or the postgres gems (pg and dm_postgres_adapter) won't install.

http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/oneiric-updates/postgresql-9.1

sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-9.1
sudo apt-get -y install libpq-dev

Install ncurses ...

sudo apt-get -y install libncurses5-dev

On my system I had to create a symbolic link for the library to load correctly:

sudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5 libncursesw.so


Install berkeley db...

I am now running Ubuntu Saucy (13.10) but our library for berkeley db is a bit
old.  The last version it recognizes is 4.7, so we need to install that.  To do this 
in Ubuntu using the package manager you should:

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

and add the line:

deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian squeeze main contrib non-free

and then:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install libdb4.7
sudo apt-get -y libdb4.7-dev

The following gems are required:
o haml
o sinatra
o data_mapper
o rmail
o pg
o dm-postgres-adapter
o ffi-ncurses
o ruby-terminfo




As root, install each gem in turn with the command:
gem install <gem name>

I had to patch rmail to work with ruby 2.00 per:
https://github.com/strzibny/rubymail/commit/b5300ac5f74a81d268709337bf6e98eb14430f5a



After installing the gems, you must modify the postgresql's
pg_hba.conf to allow trusted connections on the local server. This
file is sometimes located in the directory:
/etc/postgresql/9.1/main

Change the lines...
# IPv4 local connections:
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host all all ::1/128 md5

and change md5 to trust...

# IPv4 local connections:
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
# IPv6 local connectio5ns:
host all all ::1/128 trust

You need to add a user to postgres ... the same user you will run the BBS
as...

So, we need to become root. in ubuntu, you must set a root password to be root.

sudo passwd

become root, then

su - postgres

createuser -s mark

mark is the name of my user account. This is the account I will run the BBS from.

Now we have to create the database. Lets call it qbbs, which is the default.


(as user mark)

createdb qbbs


http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-add-postgresql-user-account/

Your results may vary depending on your linux distribution, how you
installed postgresql and the version. You may need to use find to
find this file.

You must install the knu-ruby-bdb-v0.6.6-0-g6aa8054 package. It is
in the packages directory. It installs like any other ruby module, using
extconf.rb. If you don't install this, the BBS will not function.

The following Linux software is also required. If you are using
debain, they are available as debain packages, which may be installed
using apt-get.

o unzip

Next, copy the qbbs files from the distribution media or archive, and
place them in a directory of your choice. The recommended directory
name is "QBBS", for obvious reasons.
Now, in the directory you created, open the file consts.rb, and change
the setting ROOT_PATH="/home/mark/QBBS" to match the path that you
have installed QBBS under.

Next, run the BBS database setup utility:

ruby makedb.rb


If all goes well, this will create the QBBS database. You should now
be able to run QBBS:

ruby runsession.rb

Try connecting to your new BBS, using the following command in a term window:
telnet 127.0.0.1 2323

You should get a logon screen. The 2323 at the end of the telnet
command refers to port 2323. Because of restrictions in linux,
programs run by "regular" users cannot access ports below 1024. The
simplest and safest way around this restriction is to program your
router to "translate" this port to port 23 on the outside of your
firewall. Many, but not all, modern routers can do this.

Except my new one from my cable company can... the other solution is to use
iptables. To redirect the ports for telnet (2323 to 23) and webrick
(4567 to 80) run the following as root:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 23 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2323
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 4567

You can commit your changes so they are not lost on reboot with:

iptables-save
