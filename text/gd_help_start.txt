%GTo start a game of Global Destruction, you need at least 2 players, or
a few more, depending on how your system operator has the game
configured.  Once you have the desired players, enter "%Ystart%G" to begin
the game.  Everyone in the game (including computer players) will be
given nations and enter the game.  Once a game has begun, other users
who join the table will only be spectators and cannot play.

Before starting a game, you can choose a country by entering "%Ycountry%G"
followed by the country name you want.  For example, you could enter
"%Ycountry Las Vegas%G" to get Las Vegas as your country prior to starting.
If another player has already grabbed that country, you cannot have it.
You can enter "%Ycountry%G" by itself for a list of available countries.
Of course, if you don't go out and get a country, the computer will
assign one at random to you when the game is started.or ABM's.
