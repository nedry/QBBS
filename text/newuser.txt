to the Tardis BBS.  The BBS was originally brought on line in 1985, 
more than 25 years ago, with custom software written by the sysop at 
that time, John Lorance.  

We're back, after a few years off-line.

I would really like to develop a local community here.  For that we need
people to participate and post messages!

There are several door games available as well, including the Global
Destruction chat game (the Nuclear War card game in chat) and a real PDP
11 to play with.  You can play Dungeon on that system, or go into the
system itself to explore.

We also offer Tradewars.

The software is currently under development.  We have a real IRC server as
as a teleconference and a working QWK/REP and FidoNEt networking connectors.
 
If you would like to help develop the system, or have other comments, please 
send [F]eedback to the SYSOP.

Welcome.

The Doctor - sysop
