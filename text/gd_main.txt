%GGlobal %RDestruction %G(%WVersion 0.75%G) is a pseudo-serious game in which each
player tries to blow up all the other players.  Simply put, you are put
in charge of a small country with a major nuclear capability.  By
launching missiles, flying bombers, and using persuasion techniques,
your goal is to eliminate the population of the other nations.  Of
course, protecting your own population from their attacks is a priority
as well!  To get help on a particular topic, enter "%Yhelp <topic>%G".  For
