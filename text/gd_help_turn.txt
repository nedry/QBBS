%GOn your turn, your population automatically generates a new item.  Then,
you can use any item out of your stock.  Depending on the item you
choose, different things might happen.  Defensive items are moved into
your active defense.  Other items, such as missiles and warheads may
prompt you for a target nation.

If you were warned of incoming missiles and you have anti-missiles
ready, you can fire them with the "%Yincoming%G" command.  Unfortunately,
if you have no ABM's (anti-missiles) ready, then you can't do anything
about the incoming missiles.  The "%Yincoming%G" command does not use your
turn up - you can fire ABM's at all of your incoming missiles and then
still use an item.  Incoming missiles always land right after you make
your play for the turn.  So, if you launch a missile at an opponent, it
will land when your target plays his turn.
