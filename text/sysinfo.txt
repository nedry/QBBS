%WR;About TARDIS BBS%W;

%C;This system has been in operation, in one form or antoher, since 1985. For much
of that time, it has run QBBS, our homebrew BBS software. First written in 
Turbo Pascal, it has been complete rewritten and "modernized" in Ruby.

It has run on systems ranging from an Apple //, to a Tandy 1000HD, to it's 
current home, a virtual machine running Ubuntu linux.

This (new) version of the software is a bit of a Beta.  There may be missing 
menus, or things that don't work.  Please send (F)eedback with any problems 
you find.
