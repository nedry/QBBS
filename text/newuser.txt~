to the RetroCOMPUTING BBS.  RetroCOMPUTING BBS (formerly Tardis BBS)
was originally brought on line in 1985, with custom software written by the 
sysop at that time, John Lorance.  

Now the system is back, as a multi-threaded BBS.  For more information
see the [B]ulletin section.  

There is one common sense rule on this system, respect your fellow users.

The software is currently under development.  We have a real IRC server as
as a teleconference and a working QWK/REP and FidoNEt networking connectors.

We also offer Tradewars and you can play the original text adventures, Dungeon
and Adventure (Dungeon is what became Zork I,II, and III) on a *real* PDP 11/70
that is connected to the BBS.  
 
If you would like to help develop the system, or have other comments, please 
send [F]eedback to the SYSOP.

Welcome.
