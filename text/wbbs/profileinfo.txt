%G;The Registry of Users helps you get to know other users of this system.
And, you can describe yourself, so that others can get to know YOU.

When you create your Registry entry, the answers you give to the various
questions become AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.  Please do not enter any
confidential information!  If you don't want to answer a given question,
just type "N/A", "unlisted", or words to that effect.

After you complete your entry, you will be able to edit it.  Feel free
to update your information as often as you like.  To see a directory of
all users now registered, select the '%C;C%G;' option from the menu below.
