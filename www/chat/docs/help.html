<h1>CGI:IRC Help</h1>

<h3>Interface</h3>

The interface of CGI:IRC is very similar to a standard graphical IRC client, it
 should be easy to use if you are familiar with IRC clients. Along the top is a
 list of tabs, there will be a tab here for each channel you are in and each
 query (private message) you have open. To close a window click the X button on
 the far right of the tab list.<br />
The userlist is on the right, when in a channel tab it will show a list of all
 the people in that channel. Double clicking a nickname will open a query with
 that user or perform whichever other action you select in the select box at the
 bottom.<br />
The text entry box should be simple, the little arrow to the right of the text
 entry area shows a toolbar that allows easy typing of colour, bold and underline. It is also where you enter all the commands.

<h3>Commands</h3>
Commands begin with / and should be familiar to anyone who has used IRC before
- here is a quick summary of the most useful commands.
<table>
<tr><td>/me</td><td>This turns the text after /me into an action, eg: /me looks
around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>/join</td><td>Joins the specified channel. eg: /join #cgiirc</td></tr>
<tr><td>/list</td><td>Lists all the channels on the network (this outputs a lot
of information).</td></tr>
<tr><td>/part</td><td>Leaves the current channel (same as clicking the X while
in the channel).</td></tr>
<tr><td>/quit</td><td>Quits IRC totally (same as clicking X in Status window).</td></tr>
<tr><td>/msg</td><td>Sends a private message to a user. eg: /msg someone Hi</td></tr>
<tr><td>/whois</td><td>Gives some information about a user.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Options</h3>
The options window lets you change some settings in CGI:IRC. Hopefully it
 should be fairly self explanatory, change a setting and it should take effect
 immediately.

<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
There are several shortcuts to help make using CGI:IRC nicer.
<table>
<tr><td>Tab</td><td>Will autocomplete a nickname or channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+number / Alt+number</td><td>Will go to that number window if you number
 the windows from the left (Status = 1 and so on).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+B</td><td>Write "%B" for bold text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+C</td><td>Write "%C" for colored text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cursor Up/Down</td><td>Move in the command history.</td></tr>
</table>
