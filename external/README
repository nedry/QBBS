Asciiquarium is a modified version of the ascii aquarium for use with QBBS.

This is a perl script, and therefore requires:

Perl
the perl curses library
the perl terminal animation library.

You must turn it on in costs.rb.  Change the setting

SCREENSAVER = false 

..to..

SCREENSAVER = true

That's it.  If it doesn't work, you've probably not got it's dependencies installed.

apt-get install libcurses-perl
